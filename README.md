Overview
=============

The iot_bridge provides a  bridge between the Robot Operating System (ROS) and the OpenHAB Home-Automation system. 

* ROS is an extremely powerful open source set of libraries and tools that help you build robot applications - providing drivers and state-of-the-art algorithms for vision, movement, etc.
[ros.org](http://www.ros.org/)

* OpenHAB is an open source system that connects to virtually any intelligent device, such as smoke detectors, motion detectors, temperature sensors, security systems, TV/audio, fingerprint scanners, lighting, 1-Wire, Wemo, CUPS, DMX, KNX, openpaths, Bluetooth, MQTT, Z-Wave, telephony, Insteon, weather sensors, and web services such as Twitter, etc. ROS also provides a basic Web GUI and Iphone/Android app for setting and dynamically viewing values.

Combine the two and you have an incredibly powerful system.

## Give your robot knowledge of the wider world
Use Cases:

* A motion detector in OpenHAB triggers and ROS dispatches the robot to the location to provide a video feed.
* ROS facial recognition recognizes a face at the door and OpenHAB unlocks the door.
* A Washing Machine indicates to OpenHAB that the load is complete and ROS dispatches a robot to move the laundry to the dryer.
* OpenHAB MQTT binding indicates that Sarah is approaching home and an OpenHAB sensor indicates that the  temperature is hot.  ROS dispatches the robot to bring Sarah's favorite beer.  OpenHAB turns on her favorite rock music and lowers the house temperature.
* A user clicks on the OpenHAB GUI on an IPAD and selects a new room location for the robot. The message is forwarded by the iot_bridge to ROS and ROS dispatches the robot.

With the iot_bridge, any OpenHAB device (essentially any IoT device) can be easily setup to publish updates to the iot_updates topic in ROS, giving a ROS robot knowledge of any Home Automation device. ROS can publish to the openhab_set topic (or openhab_command) and the device in OpenHAB will be set to the new value (or act on the specified command).

## Release History
v0.1 - Initial Release

v0.8 - Renamed openhab_bridge to iot_bridge.  *NOTE:* the ROS topic names changed from openhab_* to iot_*.  Changed from long polling to regular polling.  This significantly improves reliabilty without much performance cost.
